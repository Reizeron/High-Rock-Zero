> *Agents are operatives skilled in deception and avoidance, but trained in self-defense and the use of deadly force. Self-reliant and independent, agents devote themselves to personal goals, or to various patrons or causes.*

*Spies by any other name. Knowledgeable about political factions (especially their dirty laundry), secret societies. Have interesting entries for "latest rumors" and "little secret". The responses are locked behind higher disposition requirements than usually. - R-Zero*
