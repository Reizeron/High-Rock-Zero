> *Witchhunters are dedicated to rooting out and destroying the perverted practices of dark cults and profane sorcery. They train for martial, magical, and stealthy war against vampires, witches, warlocks, and necromancers.*

*Knowledgeable about: daedra cults, witch covens, necromancers, vampires and lycanthropes with heavy bias against those. May freely discuss the ways of dealing with the above and their natural weaknesses.- R-Zero*
