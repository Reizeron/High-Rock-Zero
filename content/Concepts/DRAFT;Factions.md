> Province of High Rock.
> 
> Three courtly factions - Court of Daggerfall, Court of Wayrest, Court of Camlorn (or Orsinium)
> 
> Three clan factions - Clans of Norcambria, Clans of Normar, Clans of the Reach
> 
> Both divisions could have the same trichotomy of Warrior, Mage, Thief as the Imperial Guilds and the three Great Houses in MW. Dunno about the courts but Reach is Mage, Normar could be Trader/Thief and Norcambria could be Highlander Warrior.
> 
> In the courtly factions, the highest rank is Monarch (R11) and the highest rank you can achieve is Steward (R10), and it can be implied that you can use your position to usurp the monarch.
> 
> In the clan factions the highest rank is King (R11) which is vacant in Norcambria and Normar (but present as the Evermor Witch-King) and the highest rank you can achieve is Chieftain. And it can be implied that you can use your position to unite either the Normar or Norcambria clans into a new kingdom, or usurp the Witch-King. 
> I guess Wayrest would be Trader/Thief which would leave either Daggerfall-Mage and Orsinium-Warrior or Camlorn-Mage and Daggerfall-Warrior
