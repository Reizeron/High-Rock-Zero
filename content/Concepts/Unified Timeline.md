3E~ The character Emperor sent, found that King Lysandus was not killed in the Battle of Cryngaine, but a minor lord, the Lord Woodborne of Wayrest, killed him. After the character avanged King Lysandus, the army of undead leave Daggerfall. The minor quest The Emperor gave to the character leads the character to The Great Numidium (Anumidum), the giant golem that helped Tiber Septim conquered Tamriel. To whom the Numidium was given is still a mistery. This confusing event was called Warp in the West, where it is said six Numidium were seen in six different places at once, each one carving out a different mortal's destiny. We could see that High Rock is unified no more, that the flags of Nova Orsinium are real, that the Sload Priests talk to their new God of Worms, and none of them serve the sick heir of the Septim line; we could see all this and know that it is true.
