> The usual Imperial arrogance. The hoary old "Out of Atmora" theory has been widely discredited (no reputable archaeologist would publicly support it these days), but the Imperial Geographers continue to beat the drum of the Nordic Fatherland in the best tradition of the Septim Empire. They seem to think that the imprimature of officialdom gives their outdated scholarship added weight -- which, unfortunately, it appears to in the eyes of the ever-gullible public which continues to snap up the latest Pocket Guides along with the rest of their Imperial Certified pablum. - Hasphat Antabolis

> **Antabolis Hasphat**Â (Kurt Kuhlmann): I would not take the ravings of this "Michael" too seriously. He has never been published in the Journal of Ancient Tamrielic History, and was dismissed from the his position at the University of Gwylim for persisting in reading aloud portions of the long-debunked "Monkey Truth" during faculty meetings.

> All modern scholars agree that Chimer means "Crafty Folk". "Changed Folk" is rank speculation based on early reports from the excavation of Dagon Fell (which I supervised), and has been resoundingly disproven in my recently published article, "Dunmer and Chimer in the Mythic Era: A Social History" (JATH 5897.3).
