Druidism is an offshoot of the Old Ways (egalitarian ancestor worship of people in the past) with a heavy nature spirit and faerie cult spin.
Had two main branches, Galenic Druidism and Valenic Druidism, being employed by the pre-elven nedic communities of High Rock and the Bosmer respectively.
These two branches originate from Valen and Galen, two mythical brother-prophets and Heralds of Jephre who have parted ways at some point.

Galenic druidism branch seeks to expand their ancestral/bloodline powers by making their subjects mix with other peoples and gain access to more ancestral spirits. In general, focuses more on blood as a medium for the communion with their ancestors.
Old bretic name is Druadaa Galann, this is where the name of Druadach Highlands comes from.

Galenic Druids encounter Altmer settlers in High Rock, encourage mass interbreeding with the elves as they see the marriage of men and mer as healing of the Old and Wandering Ehlnofey split and a way back to Divinity.
Just like how Dwemer attempted to reach Dawn through anti-creation, Galenics tried to do that through miscegenation, in a direct opposition of the Altmeri way. Remains of this philosophy are still seen in some of the Reachman beliefs and customs.
This eventually gave rise to the Breton race as we know it.

The other offshoots include:
Centaurs, who are descended from a Galenic tribe who attempted to mix with Kelpies - the equine shapeshifting river-spirits of Bjoulsae and its tributaries.
Jehennoths, who are a product of forced reawakening of ancestral blood in some of Jehanna's denizens.
Other powerful Breton bloodlines that may have a supernatural ancestor.
