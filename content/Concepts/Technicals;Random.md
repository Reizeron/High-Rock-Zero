>Meridia, the Secret Fire, is considered the mother of life, purity, and potential in Bretonic culture. Once a lover of Auri-El, she broke with him for assisting Sheor in creation. Too proud to flee with her father Magnus, she carved out a sphere in Oblivion from which she challenges the free will of man. Her followers are known to be haughty and spiteful of displays of [[individuality]], yet hold an unrivaled passion for life itself, considering it their duty to destroy all which corrupts its ideal forms.

>The Dunmer hate necromancy and the undead, and hate blood vampires in particular. Blood vampires are [[powerful]] undead creatures that feed on humanoid blood. The vampire curse is contracted from disease-contaminated blood; victims of vampire attacks sometimes become vampires. There is no known cure for vampirism but the destruction of the vampire. Ash vampires are not blood vampires; though both are powerful immortal undead, ash vampire do not feed on blood, and have no connection with blood vampires.

>Imperial culture regards blood vampires as destructive monsters to be hunted and destroyed. However, romantic notions of noble, virtuous vampires persist in Imperial traditions, and vampires are thought to pass unrecognized in the Mages Guild and the Imperial aristocracy.
