>The durzog is a mighty semi-aquatic beast native to the rivers of Hammerfell. In High Rock they're mostly found in the muddy waters of the lower Bjoulsae, where they come from the rainforests of the Bantha that lie to the south across the river. Some goblin clans use durzogs as warbeasts, and I even heard that "durzog" means "sludgepuppy" in the goblin tongue. That'd be one ugly puppy if you ask me.
