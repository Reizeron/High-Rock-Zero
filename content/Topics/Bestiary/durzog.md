>The durzog is a mighty semi-aquatic beast native to the rivers of [[Hammerfell]]. In [[High Rock]] they're mostly found in the muddy waters of the lower [[Bjoulsae]], where they come from the rainforests of the Bantha that lie to the south across the river. Some goblin clans use durzogs as warbeasts, and I even heard that "durzog" means "sludgepuppy" in the goblin tongue. That'd be one ugly puppy if you ask me.
