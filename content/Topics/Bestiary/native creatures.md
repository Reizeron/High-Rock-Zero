>Vvardenfell has many native creatures, some more dangerous than others. The main varieties are: kwama, [[flying creatures]], herd animals, large bipedal predators, [[small predators]], and [[water creatures]]. Two types of creatures are particularly dangerous, because they carry disease: diseased creatures -- creatures suffering from milder local common diseases -- and blighted creatures -- creatures suffering from the more dangerous blight diseases.
