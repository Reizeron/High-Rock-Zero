>Necromancy is not illegal, per se, in [[the Empire]], though body and spirit are protected as property, and may not be used without permission of the owner, and public display of the living dead is widely prohibited. Mages may purchase corpses and souls for philosophical research, and may do with them as they wish in private. [[Necromancers]] and [[vampires]] are widely confused in the public mind, and persecuted, but in remote locations, [[necromancers]] are free to pursue their studies without legal interference.
