>Let me tell you about current events. The [[Kingdoms of High Rock]] engage in constant border conflicts with each other. The [[Skyrim]] forces in [[Jehanna]] are fighting a war of attrition against the local resistance. The [[Direnni]] are desperately trying to restore their reputation damaged by the former Lady Castellan's scandalous behavior. The Imperial authorities are trying to stamp out the rising pro-Arcturian sentiment in press and academia. The asylums fill with the lunatics of all kinds by day.

>Let me tell you about current events. The Great Houses are always fighting each other in the Great House Wars. There's always trouble between outlanders -- non-Dunmer Imperial colonists -- and the Dunmer natives. The Temple is at war with a rebellious faction called the Dissident Priests. A secret cult called the Sixth House is killing Imperial citizens. Misshapen monsters and diseases called 'blight disease' are spreading from Red Mountain, a volcano where the Devil Dagoth Ur and his ash vampires live.
