>While the term "lycanthrope" originally referred to the ubiquitous [[werewolves]], it's now commonly used for all kinds of werebeasts. Two other varieties can be found in High Rock - the [[wereboars]] and the [[werebears]], the latter appearing mostly in the colder northern regions of the province. Lycanthropes are universally reviled throughout the Empire, the only exception being perhaps the Western Reach where witch covens hold the most sway over the local population.
