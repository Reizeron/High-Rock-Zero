>While the term "lycanthrope" originally referred to the ubiquitous [[werewolves]], it's now commonly used for all kinds of werebeasts. Two other varieties can be found in [[High Rock]] - the [[wereboars]] and the [[werebears]], the latter appearing mostly in the colder northern regions of the province. Lycanthropes are universally reviled throughout [[the Empire]], the only exception being perhaps the [[Western Reach]] where witch covens hold the most sway over the local population.
