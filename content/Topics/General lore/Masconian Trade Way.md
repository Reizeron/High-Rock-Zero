>Masconian Trade Way was a trade route established back in the First Era by a conglomerate of merchant families operating along [[Bjoulsae]] and [[Karth]] rivers in then Bretony, the Reach and Skyrim, led by an influential merchant-prince of Wayrest, Perceval Mascon. This early precursor to the [[Merchants Guild]] negotiated with the local rulers on the matter of tolls and protection against bandits and pirates, dominating the trade in the region for centuries until the [[Thrassian Plague]].
