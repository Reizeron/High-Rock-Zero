>According to Imperial custom, killing is justifiable in war, self-defense, defense of property, and [[affairs of honor]]. Other killings are murder, and punishable by [[Fines and compensation]], or by [[punitive labor]]. Outlaws have no rights, and may be killed without scandal or sanction. Guards may use deadly force in the line of duty.
