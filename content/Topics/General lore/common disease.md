>There are fifteen common diseases I've encountered in High Rock: [[blood rot]], [[brain fever]], [[chrondiasis]], [[consumption]], [[red death]], [[stomach rot]], [[swamp rot]], [[wizard fever]], [[wound rot]], [[witches pox]], [[Caliron's curse]], [[gray fever]], [[lunar chills]], [[witchwither]] and [[rotbone]]. We group their effects in three levels: mild, serious, and acute. Serious and acute are more dangerous, of course, but none of them are fatal. But you must get them cured, or they weaken you, and people won't want to talk to you.
