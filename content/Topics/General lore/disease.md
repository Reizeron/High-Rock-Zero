>In [[High Rock]] you worry about three kinds of disease -- [[common disease]], [[soul sickness]] and [[profane disease]]. [[Common disease]] isn't so bad. You can get cured at [[shrines]] or temples easily -- but you need to get cured, or people don't want to talk with you. Diseases of the soul are much more dangerous and may require a stay in an asylum. But the worst of all are the profane diseases which change the person's very nature for the worse, often irreversibly.

>In Morrowind you worry about three kinds of disease -- common disease, blight disease, and corprus disease. Common disease isn't so bad. You can get cured at shrines or temples easily -- but you need to get cured, or people don't want to talk with you. Blight disease is more serious, and potions and cures are harder come by. Corprus disease can't be cured. And some say vampirism is a disease. But the only cure for a vampire is destroying it. Policy on vampires is 'kill on sight.' Or 'run on sight.'
