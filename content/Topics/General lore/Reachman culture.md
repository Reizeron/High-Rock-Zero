>[[Reachmen]] live in isolated mining towns, small agricultural villages and wandering herder tribes and have retained much of their customs from the days of the autocratic [[witch-kings]] of old.

The [[clans of the Reach]] are deceptively numerous and well-connected and their society is built around submission to the charismatic sorcerer-priest caste.
