>Aetherius is the realm of infinite Light and Magic that is thought of as the birthplace of the [[Aedra]] and the origin of all souls. It is separated from the mortal realm by the vast black sea of [[Oblivion]] and can only be perceived as the light of the Sun and Stars. Little is known about Aetherius since it has proven itself impossible to be physically reached by the living, but it can still be studied by the means of astrology and divine revelation, as well as by examining the scarce fallen materia.
