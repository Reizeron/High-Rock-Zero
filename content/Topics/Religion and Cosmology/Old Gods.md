>The moniker "Old Gods" refers to obscure entities worshipped as gods by prehistoric ancestors of the Bretons. Their actual cults are long dead, the only surviving remains of that religion being the [[standing stones]] sometimes found in the wilderness and the local folk tales. The few Old Gods we still know of are: [[Raen]], the God of Agriculture; [[Notorgo]], the Messenger God; [[Vigryl]], the God of the Sea, [[Q'Olwen]], the God of Wisdom and [[Druagaa]], the Goddess of Flowers.

>The so-called "Old Gods" are nothing but characters from the old faerie tales and a bunch of primitive superstitions. Nothing good comes out of taking these seriously and those eccentrics who try often end up being entangled in some heathen cult nonsense, or just found dead in the wilderness.
