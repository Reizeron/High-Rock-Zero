>As law-abiding citizens of the Empire, we hold both the Emperor and his esteemed ancestor in utmost respect. Regrettably, certain popular aspects of Tiber Septim's worship, especially those of Nordic origin, are decidedly anti-Aldmeri in nature and the historic fact remains that his deification was a matter of state politics above all else.

>According to the official accounts, [[Tiber Septim]] was born on the continent of Atmora under the name of 'Talos', meaning 'Stormcrown'. He conquered all of Tamriel and ushered in the Third Era and the Third Empire, and took a Cyrodilic name when he became the Emperor. A narrative more common in High Rock identifies Tiber Septim as [[Hjalti Early-Beard]], a native of Alcaire. A sect known as [[Arcturians]] goes further and asserts that historic Tiber Septim is in fact an amalgamation of two or more individuals.

> Tiber Septim's worship is still a contentious issue in High Rock:
> - Talos cult is too Nordic for the local Breton population
> - Bretons know Tiber Septim is Hjalti Early-Beard, their Alcairian-born compatriot.
> - Bretons also prefer the more formalistic Nibenean Tiberius Imperator Cult (the Citizenship Cult)
> - The Aedric Orders refuse any attempt of ecumenism on the issue, perhaps under pressure from their Summerset metropoly
> - The recent rise of anti-Nordicism and Arcturianism further complicates the issue.
