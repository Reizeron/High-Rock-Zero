>Phynaster is an ancestral spirit and a patron of pilgrims and questing knights. In ages past, he traveled all across Tamriel in search of lost Aldmeri kin. He taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride, but tragically his own life was cut short by the jealous [[Baan Dar]]. Clan [[Direnni]] claims close blood kinship with Phynaster.

>Lord Phynaster is the ancestor-spirit of Clan [[Direnni]]. In the Merethic era he discovered the [[Adamantine Tower]] and achieved enlightenment after long meditations at its very summit, before returning to the Summerset islands. Centuries later, his descendants claimed [[Balfiera]] as their birthright and established the [[Direnni Convent]] Of Phynaster And All the Aedra.
