>Namira the Ghost-Eater is considered the mother of dualisms, disorder, and decay in Bretonic culture. It is said she was born when Sheor looked upon her void-veiled form and felt inspired to introduce struggle to his creation. With struggle came death, and she fed upon the souls of its victims until [[Arkay]]'s intervention. Her followers are known to be contemptuous of mortal life, actively infringing on the laws of [[Arkay]] to satiate their goddess with forlorn souls and ultimately escape the cycle themselves.
