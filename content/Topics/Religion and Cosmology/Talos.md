>According to the conventional history, [[Tiber Septim]] was born on the continent of Atmora as 'Talos', and then took a Cyrodilic name when he became Emperor of Tamriel. The charismatic worship of Tiber Septim in his warlord aspect of Talos -- the [[Talos Cult]] -- is most popular among the people of Skyrim and Colovia who form the bulk of the Imperial Legion troops. In Skyrim he's also known as  Ysmir, 'Dragon of the North,' and is invoked as the patron of questing heroes.
