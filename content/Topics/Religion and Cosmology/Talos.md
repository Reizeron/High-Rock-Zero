>According to the conventional history, [[Tiber Septim]] was born on the continent of Atmora as 'Talos', and then took a Cyrodilic name when he became Emperor of Tamriel. The charismatic worship of [[Tiber Septim]] in his warlord aspect of Talos -- the [[Talos Cult]] -- is most popular among the people of [[Skyrim]] and Colovia who form the bulk of the Imperial Legion troops. In [[Skyrim]] he's also known as  Ysmir, 'Dragon of the North,' and is invoked as the patron of questing heroes.
