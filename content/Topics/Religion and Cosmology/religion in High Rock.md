>Through millennia of missionary activity, the religious life in High Rock came to be dominated by the Imperial cult of the [[Nine Divines]], but an older Elven religion called the [[Aedric Orders]] still maintains a sizable minority of worshippers. The veneration of the [[Old Gods]] survives only in folk customs, meanwhile [[Daedra worship]] is widespread, but is kept mostly nonpublic. Beyond that, there exists a wide multitude of local deities, hero-cults and esoteric societies of all kinds.
