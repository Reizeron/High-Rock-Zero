>Betmeri, or 'Beastmen', were the aboriginal inhabitants of Tamriel. Each Beast race has its own distinctive accounts of the mythic era before the coming of the [[Aldmer|Aldmeri]] and [[Human|Humans]]; each Beast race is as culturally and physically distinct from one another as it is from Elven and Manish races.

>The peaceful [[Khajiit]] and [[Argonian]] races are the most numerous and culturally advanced of the Beast races; the war-loving [[Orc]] tribes are relatively few in number and widely scattered, but notable as superior warriors and weapon crafters. Other smaller Beast races, like [[goblin|Goblins]], Imga, and Giants, are limited to mountainous areas in the west and north of Tamriel, and seldom encountered in the East.
