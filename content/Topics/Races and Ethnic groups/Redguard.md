>[!dialogue] Class;Savant
>Redguards consider themselves the most gifted warriors of Tamriel. The dark-skinned, wiry-haired people of [[Hammerfell]] are born to battle, though pride and independent spirit makes them better scouts or skirmishers, or free-ranging heroes and adventurers, than rank-and-file soldiers. They are quick of foot and hardy of constitution, and quickly adopt new weapon and armor styles.

>[!dialogue] Race;Redguard
>We are warriors by nature, quick of foot and hardy of constitution. We are good with all weapons and armors. Look for us in the thick of battle.

>[!dialogue] Race;Dunmer Class;Noble
>Redguards are loud, loutish, and boastful. With education and discipline, they make passable mercenaries. They are stubborn and bloody-minded, but courageous and tough. They have little aptitude for the arcane arts, but they are quick enough to make good archers and skirmishers. They have little respect for law or tradition, and are often successful as smugglers and bandits.
