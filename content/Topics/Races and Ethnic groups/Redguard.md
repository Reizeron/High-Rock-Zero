>Redguards consider themselves the most gifted warriors of Tamriel. The dark-skinned, wiry-haired people of Hammerfell are born to battle, though pride and independent spirit makes them better scouts or skirmishers, or free-ranging heroes and adventurers, than rank-and-file soldiers. They are quick of foot and hardy of constitution, and quickly adopt new weapon and armor styles.
