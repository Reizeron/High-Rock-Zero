>Altmer are the light-skinned, tall Elven peoples of the [[Summerset Isle|Summerset Isles]]. 'High' is taken to mean variously 'tall,' 'proud,' and 'culturally snobbish.' In [[the Empire]], 'High Elves' is the common usage. They consider themselves the most civilized culture of Tamriel, and, in truth, the common tongue of [[the Empire]], Tamrielic, is based on their speech and writing, and most of [[the Empire]]'s arts, crafts, and sciences are derived from High Elven traditions.

>We Altmer are proud, wise, and beautiful. [[The Empire]] is built on the arts, crafts, and sciences of the High Elves. Our pure blood protects us from disease, and makes us superior spellcrafters.

>The Altmer are proud, conceited, and decadent. Their clothes, manners, arts, and crafts are highly refined, but they are godless and spiritually empty. They content themselves with reliving the aged glories of their martial traditions and their mastery of sorcery and enchantment. Their achievements are admirable, but their culture no longer serves any vital purpose.
