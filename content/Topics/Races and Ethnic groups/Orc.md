>The Orc peoples of the [[Kingdom of Orsinium]] are brave and hardy barbarians. Once they were feared and hated by everyone else in Tamriel. Now many have gained an education and Imperial citizenship through service in the legions. Their armorers are the finest in the world, and Orc warriors in heavy armor are the best front-line troops in all Tamriel. Detractors say that Orcs are rough and cruel, but Orcs say they are hard, but fair, and stern, but just.

>The nobility of Orsinium prefer to call themselves [[Orsimer]], or 'The Pariah Folk' and further emphasize their [[Aldmer|Aldmeri]] ancestry by worshipping the lost aedric spirit [[Trinimac]].

>They call us barbarians because we are brave in war and we laugh at hardship. But we have earned our citizenship by service in the legions, and we are as civilized as any race. We make the finest weapons and armor in the world, and our warriors are the bravest and toughest in Tamriel.

>Orcs are the beast barbarians of the Wrothgarian and Dragontail Mountains. They are wonderful warriors and armorers, but they are not civilized beings, and they worship the Bad Daedra. They have come as legion veterans to settle in Morrowind, and by law, they have rights as citizens. Many serve us as reliable mercenaries and hirelings, and as a people, they may someday come to be civilized. But many Orcs are savages and outlaws, and as a race they cannot be trusted.
