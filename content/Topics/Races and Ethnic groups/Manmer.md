>While in the most general sense of this term it may refer to any group of persons with shared mannish-elven ancestry, it's long been used as a moniker for the [[Breton]] race in general. And while the term is considered neutral in the academic field, it has often been used in a derogatory sense by both man and mer supremacists, and as such has largely fallen out of use, especially in High Rock.
