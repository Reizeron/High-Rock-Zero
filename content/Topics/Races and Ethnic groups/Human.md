>The human races are short-lived, socially aggressive humanoids, shorter than [[Aldmer|Aldmeri]] and more technologically advanced than [[Betmer|Betmeri]]. Warlike human cultures have subjugated their Elven and Beastfolk neighbors and synthesized their arts, literature, magick, technology, and theology into Tamriel's dominant culture -- the Empire. Obsessed with progress and destiny, human civilization constantly reinvents itself from materials plundered from conquered cultures and re-shaped by human myths and dreams.
