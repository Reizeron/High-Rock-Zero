>The races commonly encountered in High Rock are: [[Redguard]], [[Breton]], [[Nord]], [[Altmer]], [[Dunmer]], [[Bosmer]], [[Imperial]], [[Khajiit]], [[Argonian]] and [[Orc]], as well as some other [[native beastfolk]] races. Bretons are the native majority, there is a very sizable Orcish minority as well as historic Altmer, Nordic and Imperial diasporas. [[Reachmen]] often consider themselves a separate people but the Imperial Government officially defines them as a Breton subethnicity.

>As mercenaries, Imperials and Redguards are more popular in Wayrest and Evermor, Altmer and Bosmer in Daggerfall and Farrun, Dunmer are welcome in Shornhelm as Nords are in Daggerfall, Camlorn and Northpoint. Orsinium meanwhile is always eager to employ their estranged Orcish kin.
