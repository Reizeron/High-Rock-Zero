>The races commonly encountered in [[High Rock]] are: [[Redguard]], [[Breton]], [[Nord]], [[Altmer]], [[Dunmer]], [[Bosmer]], [[Imperial]], [[Khajiit]], [[Argonian]] and [[Orc]], as well as some other [[native beastfolk]] races. [[Breton|Bretons]] are the native majority, there is a very sizable Orcish minority as well as historic [[Altmer]], Nordic and Imperial diasporas. [[Reachmen]] often consider themselves a separate people but the Imperial Government officially defines them as a [[Breton]] subethnicity.

>As mercenaries, Imperials and [[Redguard|Redguards]] are more popular in Wayrest and Evermor, [[Altmer]] and Bosmer in [[Daggerfall]] and Farrun, Dunmer are welcome in Shornhelm as Nords are in [[Daggerfall]], Camlorn and Northpoint. Orsinium meanwhile is always eager to employ their estranged Orcish kin.
