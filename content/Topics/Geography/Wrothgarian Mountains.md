>The forested peaks and deep, narrow valleys of Wrothgarian mountains are occupied by both the [[clans of Kambray]] and the [[clans of Normar]], ever in conflict with each other and the local [[Orc|Orcs]] over the alpine pastures and hunting grounds. Caverns, mines and secret underground passages litter every mile of this labyrinthine region. Traditionally, the [[Kingdom of Shornhelm]] was the most influential local state, but it has been hopelessly eclipsed by the newly created [[Kingdom of Orsinium]] in the last decade.
