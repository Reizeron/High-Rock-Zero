>The rocky island of Balfiera is located in the [[Iliac Bay]] and is most famously known as the location of the [[Adamantine Tower]]. Most of the island's population dwells inside the massive palace complex surrounding it called the [[Direnni Tower]], built in ages past by the rulers of the island, elven clan [[Direnni]]. The rest of the island is dotted by mausoleums of the clan's human retainers and has few living inhabitants.
