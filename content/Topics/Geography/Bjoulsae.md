>Bjoulsae is the largest river in Western Tamriel. It takes its source in the highlands of [[Western Reach]] and flows westward, merging with many tributaries on the way and forming a massive muddy delta where it drains into the [[Iliac Bay]]. Settlements along the river itself are few and it's mostly nomadic Bjoulsae [[river tribes]] that herd their horses in its basin valleys. Much of Bjoulsae coast is currently controlled by the [[Kingdom of Orsinium]].

>The river Bjoulsae is a historically important trade artery in the northwestern Tamriel. A wide assortment of goods is transported inland on barges pulled by burlags -- the towmen, who tend to be destitute [[Orc|orcs]] or [[river tribes]] people. Together with the river [[Karth]] it formed the basis for the [[Masconian Trade Way]], connecting the inland regions with the trade hubs of [[Iliac Bay]] and the [[Sea of Ghosts]].

>The Mighty Bjoulsae has marked the southern border of our Breton homeland ever since the early First Era, when the Ra'Gada forces overwhelmed the Breton defense lines in the Dragontails and captured the Left-bank Bjoulsae, now known as the Bantha region. The river has formed a natural bulwark against any further incursions, becoming a powerful symbol of resilience and the origin of the famous saying "what can't be stopped by solid rock can be stopped by running waters".
