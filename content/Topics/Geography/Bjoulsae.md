>The river Bjoulsae is the largest river in Western Tamriel. It's an important trade artery, having been used to transport goods between the cities of Iliac Bay and the inlands of Skyrim and Hammerfell for millenia. It takes its source from the eastmost highlands of Western Reach and Bend'r-Mahk, finding its way through its steep labyrinthine canyons and flows all the way west into the Iliac Bay near the city of Wayrest where it has deposited massive mud islands in its delta.

>Settlements along the river itself are few and it's mostly nomadic Bjoulsae [[river tribes]] that herd their horses in the basin valleys. Much of Bjoulsae coast is currently controlled by the [[Kingdom of Orsinium]]

>The Mighty Bjoulsae has been the southern border of our Breton homeland ever since the early First Era, when the invading Ra'Gada forces easily overwhelmed the original Breton defense line in the Dragontail mountains but came at a surprising still when they've hit the river, in the event known as The Great Bjoulsae Standing of 1E 812.

>In the end, while Redguard hordes did succeed in capturing the Left-bank Bjoulsae  region, now known as the Bantha, the river itself has formed a natural bulwark against any further incursions. It is as such a powerful symbol of resilience for the Breton people and the origin of the famous saying "what can't be stopped by solid rock can be stopped by running waters".
