>High Rock encompasses the many lands and clans of [[Greater Bretony]], the [[Dellese Isles]], the [[Bjoulsae]] [[river tribes]], and, by tradition, the [[Western Reach]]. The rugged highland strongholds and isolated valley settlements have encouraged the fierce independence of the various local [[Breton]] clans, and this contentious tribal nature has never been completely integrated into a provincial or Imperial identity. Nonetheless, their language, bardic traditions, and heroic legends are a unifying common legacy.
