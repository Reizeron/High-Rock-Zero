A land of endless wilderness, untouched forests and rolling hills, the Western Reach stands in sharp contrast to the heavily urbanized [[Greater Bretony]]. Settlements are small, few and far between and travel is mostly done along the great Bjoulsae and her tributaries. The [[Kingdom of Evermor]] holds the only semblance of power in this region, its eponymous capital being the only city-sized settlement, but its real grip on the native [[Reachmen]] and [[river tribes]] is dubious at best.
