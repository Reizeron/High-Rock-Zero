>A land of endless wilderness, untouched forests and rolling hills, the Western Reach stands in sharp contrast to the heavily urbanized [[Greater Bretony]]. Settlements are small, few and far between and travel is mostly done along the great Bjoulsae and her tributaries. The local [[Reachmen]] organized in the [[clans of the Reach]] only begrudgingly accept the rule of the Empire and prefer to answer to their own pretender [[witch-kings]].
