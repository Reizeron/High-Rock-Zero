>[[High Rock]] is the northwesternmost province of the Tamrielic Empire. It borders Skyrim in the east and has a long land and sea border with Hammerfell in the south. It is bounded by the Sea of Ghosts and [[Balothian Bay]] on the north, [[Iliac Bay]] on the south and the [[Eltheric Ocean]] on the west. The [[Bjoulsae]] river serves as a natural border with Hammerfell, with High Rock occupying its rugged right bank.

>The majority of High Rock's population lives in the hospitable western peninsula of [[Greater Bretony]] which is separated from the wilder, harsher regions of [[Western Reach]] and the [[Northern Coast]] by the peaks of the [[Wrothgarian Mountains]].  The Isle of [[Balfiera]] and the [[Dellese Isles]] are located in the [[Iliac Bay]] and off the [[Northern Coast]] respectively.
