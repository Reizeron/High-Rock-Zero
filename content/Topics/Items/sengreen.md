>Sengreen is an extremely hardy medicinal plant with modest alchemical properties, also known as "Herbalist's Bane" due to the sheer difficulty of getting it to dry out. It can be found growing in the Western Reach, both in the wild and cultivated by the locals.

>Sengreen? Here we just call it "thunderplant", nicer name if you ask me. You can see it growing on the house roofs here and there, wonder why? Because it protects us from them lightnings, or at least that's what the old folk say. I usually keep a branch on me when out in the storm, just in case.
