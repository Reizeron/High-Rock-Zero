>Making potions requires pieces of specialized alchemical equipment called 'apparatus.' Better quality apparatus are more reliable in their results, and produce a finer product. The four types of apparatus are: [[mortar and pestle]], [[retort]], [[alembic]], and [[calcinator]]. Apparatus can be purchased from alchemists.
