>The instruments of labor commonly employed by trade guilds include such tools as: an alchemy [[apparatus]], an [[armorer's hammer]], [[lockpicks]] and [[probes]], a chef's knife, a loom, a telescope and much more. Depending on their quality the tools come in the grades of Apprentice, Journeyman, Master and Grandmaster. Some say there are tools of even higher quality accessible only to the top ranking guildsmen, but I've never seen any myself.
