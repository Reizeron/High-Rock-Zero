>Each of the [[Kingdoms of High Rock]] has its own royal court which consists of the local nobility, their retinue and servants and is headed by the local monarch. The courtiers handle all matters of state according to their rank and title, and while many positions are hereditary, there are cases of ambitious individuals climbing through the ranks from from the lowest chambermaid or a footsoldier to the high steward, being granted titles of nobility and membership in the local [[knightly orders]].

One typically can't be a member of more than one royal court at the same time, beyond wielding a honorary title in some exceptional cases.
