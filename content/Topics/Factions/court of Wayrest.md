> The [[court of Wayrest]] serves Queen Elysana, whose family crest is three argent roses on an azure escutcheon with copper bordure, often called 'The White Rose of Wayrest'. Wayrest is a trade power, and the council of merchant-princes, all ranking members of the [[Order of the White Rose]], hold considerable sway in the court.
