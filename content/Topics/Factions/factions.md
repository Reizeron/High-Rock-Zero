>The province of High Rock is notorious for its byzantine political landscape, defined by a myriad of interest groups acting in support or against each other. These can be broadly divided into the following categories: the [[Imperial factions]] that represent the interests of the Imperial metropoly, the [[native Breton factions]] that represent the local population and nobility and the enigmatic [[secret societies]] whose true interests are often obscure.

>Observers of Vvardenfell's politics have identified eleven main factions, some aligned with Imperial interests, some aligned with native Dunmer interests. The primary Imperial factions are the Imperial cult, the Imperial legions, and the Fighters, Mages, and Thieves Guilds. The primary native Dunmer factions are the three Great Houses, Redoran, Hlaalu, and Telvanni, the Temple, and the Morag Tong. The Ashlander barbarians are native Dunmer, but are opposed to both the Empire and the settled Dunmer.
