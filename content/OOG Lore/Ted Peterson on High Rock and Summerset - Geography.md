Atharaon:
"The general shape of Tamriel has been consistent since Arena. Even in Daggerfall, the continent map of Tamriel is the same shape we expect. However, the in-game Iliac Bay map differs substantially, especially the High Rock peninsula. It looks like it was cut off prematurely around where Glenpoint was in Arena.
Is that so, and why did that happen?"
Ted:
"The Daggerfall game map needed to fit a rectangle shape. It wasn’t made to have north at the top, but to fit in as much of the Iliac Bay as possible. The goal was to take an in-depth look at Iliac Bay specifically."
Atharaon:
"A couple of places appear to have shifted dramatically between TES1 and TES2. Daggerfall city is a major example. Normally on the west coast, here it appears on the east. You wrote A History of Daggerfall, a lorebook within the game that describes the city as in the west. What is happening here?"
Ted:
"A big part of the background is the War of Betony, a dispute between Daggerfall and Sentinel over control of the island. We wanted to have Betony be halfway between the two cities. I didn’t have a strong preference for the east or west coast as long as that geographical relationship was maintained for the story. It should probably be on the ocean and to the south of the peninsula."
Atharaon:
"Was Camlorn meant to be outside of the area of the map, just above where it cuts off at the top?"
Ted:
"That makes sense."
Atharaon:
"In terms of the placement of locations in TES2, was it intended that those nearest the southwest end (e.g. Tulune, Glenumbra Moors, Shalgora…) would’ve been placed further down on a true-size peninsula map, or is it only the Daggerfall territory itself that has been shrunk and the rest are in their proper locations?
Ted:
"I wanted to have settlements near a source of water. That’s the main thing. However, we weren’t able to put every city near one due to technical constraints, so they all appear further inland than they should be. The map was procedurally generated. I came up with the names, but the procedural generation said where they would be placed. My preference is to have them on the coast.
Atharaon:
"Let’s talk about specific places then. If we were to place the towns from Daggerfall on the Arena map, can you tell me where they would be located?
(At this point I live-streamed a map with Ted so we could look at it together and annotate as agreed.)

Ted:
"Sure."
Atharaon:
"Would we keep Daggerfall where it is in Arena? (“Daggerfall A” on the map)"
Ted:
"Yep. As long as Betony is midway between there and Sentinel."
Atharaon:
"What about Tulune?"
Ted:
"It almost sounds like a Hammerfell name. I don’t know, it doesn’t sound Breton."
Atharaon:
"Could it be elven?"
Ted:
"Could be. Let’s say that’s south of Daggerfall, on the west coast, because it’s got a less Bretonic name."
Atharaon:
"Glenumbra Moors then?"
Ted:
"That’s definitely more Breton-sounding. To the north of Daggerfall, on the west coast."
Atharaon:
"That corresponds well with your A History of Daggerfall. And Northmoor?"
Ted:
"North of Glenumbra Moors, since that’s its name."
Atharaon:
"Reich Gradkeep/Anticlere? It changes position quite considerably from Arena to Daggerfall."
Ted:
"I always favour a coastal location. I think it should be on that little bit of land jutting out in the Daggerfall map. So on the Iliac coast."
Atharaon:
"Glenpoint is described as being on the coast in The Wolf Queen but appears to be inland on both the TES1 and TES2 maps. Where would you say it should be? And is that an inlet west of it on the Arena map? It looks like a body of water cutting into the peninsula."
Ted:
"Glenpoint is a Breton name. Looking on the map, it’s hard to tell for sure. I’ll say east coast since it looks closer on the Arena map, but either works well. You decide."
(Two possibilities are then marked on the map with our names beside each. We also briefly discussed Ykalon, Phrygias and Ilessan Hills.)

Atharaon:
"You’ve introduced a LOT of places into the lore, many of which don’t make it onto the maps. What are your thoughts on the locations of these places? For example, Calder, Glenmoril, Oloine, etc."
Ted:
"Some of them don’t appear because they’re not political units, such as the Ravennian Forest. I’m surprised I introduced places like Oloine and Umbington without having them on a map. I don’t know why I didn’t just choose places that already existed."
Atharaon:
"Can you confirm whether or not the Dellese Isles is the name of the island chain which includes Balfiera, or are they located elsewhere?
Ted:
"That’s PGE1, so probably better to ask Michael. I don’t know where they are but if I was to guess, I’d say they are on the other side of High Rock, in the ocean. There are too many islands in the Iliac already."
Atharaon:
"Finally, Glenumbra Moors or Glenumbria Moors? Which name is correct?"
Ted:
"Haha. I believe Glenumbria was meant to be a region, and Glenumbria Moors was a region within that region. Either spelling works."
Atharaon:
"Moving on to Summerset then. Or should I say Summurset? I know you prefer the latter."
Ted:
"That’s my fault I think. I probably used a number of different spellings. I don’t actually mind too much. It makes sense that names change over time for a number of reasons as language changes. As for where the name came from, I’m a huge Anglophile. I probably saw the name on the map and thought “Oh, that sounds nice!”"
Atharaon:
"Any suggestions for where Moridunon, Runcibae and Potansa were meant to be?"
Ted:
"I think the main idea with them was meant to be similar to that place in Harry Potter, Diagon Alley. I think of them as sort of in-between places that allow access to Artaeum. If the Psijics decide to let you join them or if you want to contact them, you go to these intermediate places first before you can reach Artaeum. I don’t recall exactly where they are located within Summerset."
