Bethesda's internal timeline (2000)
Dawn Era
The Cosmos is formed from the Aurbis [chaos, or totality] by Anu and Padomay.
Akatosh (Auriel) forms and Time starts. Gods (et'Ada) form.
Lorkhan convinces/tricks the Gods to create the mortal plane, Nirn. The mortal plane is highly magical and dangerous. As the Gods walk, its physical make-up and even time itself becomes unstable.
When Magic (Magnus), architect of the plans for the mortal world, decides to terminate this project, the Gods convene at the Adamantine Tower (Direnni Tower, the oldest known structure in Tamriel) and decide what to do. Most leave when Magic does. Others sacrifice themselves into other forms to Stay (the Ehlnofey). In most accounts, Lorkhan is condemned to exile in the mortal realms, and his heart is torn out and cast from the Tower. Where it lands a Volcano forms. With Magic (in the Mythic Sense) gone, the Cosmos stabilizes. Elven history, finally linear, begins (ME2500).

Merethic Era
c. ME-2500 Supposed date of construction of the Adamantine Tower on Balfiera Island in High Rock, the oldest known structure of Tamriel. Earliest historical date in unpublished Elvish chronicles.
Early Merethic Era Aboriginal beastpeoples [ancestors of the Khajiit, Argonian, Orcish, and other beastfolk] live in preliterate communities throughout Tamriel.

Middle Merethic Era
Aldmeri [Elves] leave the doomed and now-lost continent of Aldmeris (also known as 'Old Ehlnofey') and settle Tamriel. First colonies are distributed widely along the entire coast of Tamriel. Later inland settlements were founded primarily in fertile lowlands in southwest and central Tamriel. The sophisticated, literate, technologically advanced Aldmeri culture drove the primitive beastfolk into the jungles, marshes, mountains, and wastelands. The Adamantine Tower is rediscovered and captured by the Direnni, a prominent and powerful Aldmeri clan. Crystal Tower is built on Summerset Isle and, later, White Gold Tower in Cyrodiil.
The Ayleids [Wild Elves] flourish in the jungles surrounding White Gold Tower (present day Cyrodiil). Wild Elves, also known as the Heartland High Elves, preserved the Dawn Era magicks and language of the Ehlnofey. Ostensibly a tribute-land to the High King of Alinor, Cyrodiil was often so isolated from the Summerset Isles as to be its own sovereign nation.
The Dwemer [Dwarves], a free-thinking, reclusive Elven clan devoted to the secrets of science, engineering, and alchemy, established underground cities and communities in the mountain range (later the Velothi Mountains) separating modern Skyrim and Morrowind.
The Chimer [ancestors of the modern Dunmer, or Dark Elves], dynamic, ambitious, long-lived Elven clans devoted to fundamentalist ancestor worship, followed the Prophet Veloth out of ancestral Elven homelands to settle in the lands now known as Morrowind. Despising the secular culture and profane practices of the Dwemer, the Chimer also coveted the lands and resources of the Dwemer, and for centuries provoked them with minor raids and territorial disputes.

Late Merethic Era
Pre-literate humans, the so-called "Nedic Peoples", from the continent of Atmora (also 'Altmora' or 'the Elder Wood' in Aldmeris) migrate and settle in northern Tamriel.
Nordic hero Ysgramor, leader of a great colonizing fleet to Tamriel, develops a runic transcription of Nordic speech based on Elvish principles, and is the first human historian. Ysgramor's fleet lands at Hsaarik Head at the extreme northern tip of Skyrim's Broken Cape. The Nords build there the legendary city of Saarthal. The Elves drive the Men away during the Night of Tears, but Ysgramor soon returns with his Five Hundred Companions.
Merethic Era - 1E660 An immortal hero, warrior, sorceror, and king variously known as Pelinal Whitestrake, Harrald Hairy Breeks, Ysmir, Hans the Fox, etc., wanders Tamriel, gathering armies, conquering lands, ruling, then abandoning his kingdoms to wander again.

First Era
1E1 Camoran Dynasty of Valenwood is founded by King Eplear. The Wood Elves (Ayleids) of White Gold Tower in the Cyrodiil heartland use this newly formed kingdom as the buffer from the influence of Alinor (Summurset Isle) kingdom. Following this event the White Gold Tower becomes an independent city-state.

The Alessian Doctrines are the very strict religious teachings of the monkey prophet, Marukh. Maruhk reportedly receives painful visions from ghost of the Slave-Queen Alessia, calling for a worldwide overthrow of Elven rule and a suppression of the Elven elements of the Eight Divines. They enforce strict codes of behavior which preclude most forms of entertainment.

1E416-1E668 Resdayn flourishes under the leadership of Dumac and Nerevar. Peace among the Chimer, and between the elves and the dwarves, brings an unprecedented prosperity and flowering of both cultures.
1E477 Clan Direnni conquers High Rock and large parts of Skyrim and Hammerfell.
1E479 Ryan Direnni outlaws the Alessian Reform and puts its major advocates to death. Direnni forces begin to harass the Colovian West, pushing for the Heartland.
1E482 Direnni Clan, under the command of Aiden Direnni, defeats the Allesian Army at Glenumbria Moor, however the cost of this victorius battle is dearly for the elves, and this war weakens their power.

2E560-2E601 The Knahaten Flu, called the Crimson Plague, plagued South East Tamriel, destroying several native tribes in Black Marsh. The reptilian Argonians alone among the tribes of Black Marsh are immune to the plague, leading to speculation, not entirely discredited by modern researchers, that a genocidal Argonian mage created the plague for his people.

3E121-3E127 War of Red Diamond. The combatants are the three surviving children of Pelagius II, Potema, Cephorus, and Magnus, and their offspring. Potema, of course, supports her son Uriel III, and also has the support of all of Skyrim and northern Morrowind. With the efforts of Cephorus and Magnus, High Rock turned. Hammerfell, Sumurset Isle, Valenwood, Elsweyr, and Black Marsh are divided, but most kings now support Cephorus and Magnus.
3E127 Uriel III is captured in the Battle of Ichidag in Hammerfell. He is burned to death by the mob while in the route to his trial. His captor and uncle, become the next Emperor of Tamriel by name of Cephorus I. But peace is still not achieved.

3E290 Uriel V is killed in Akavir on the battlefield of Ionith. Uriel VI becomes the Emperor of Tamriel. Since he is still five years old, his mother Thonica is given a restricted regency until Uriel VI reached age.
3E307 It was not until Uriel VI is 22 years old that he was given full license to rule. He has been slowly assuming positions of responsibility for years, but both the Council and his mother, who enjoyed even her limited regency, were loath to give him reign. By the time he comes to the throne, the mechanisms of government gives him little power, but the power to veto.
3E313 Uriel VI falls from his horse and can not be saved by the finest Imperial healers, his beloved sister Morihatha takes the throne. Morihatha finishes the job her brother had begun, and makes the Imperial Province truly a government under the Emperess. Outside the Imperial Province, however, the Empire has been slowly disintegrating. Open revolutions and civil wars have raged unchallenged since the days of her grandfather Cephorus II.

3E405 Another misterious character is sent by Uriel Septim VII to investigated the death of King Lysandus and to find the missing letter the Emperor sent to the Queen of Daggerfall.
3E~ The character Emperor sent, found that King Lysandus was not killed in the Battle of Cryngaine, but a minor lord, the Lord Woodborne of Wayrest, killed him. After the character avanged King Lysandus, the army of undead leave Daggerfall. The minor quest The Emperor gave to the character leads the character to The Great Numidium (Anumidum), the giant golem that helped Tiber Septim conquered Tamriel. To whom the Numidium was given is still a mistery. This confusing event was called Warp in the West, where it is said six Numidium were seen in six different places at once, each one carving out a different mortal's destiny. We could see that High Rock is unified no more, that the flags of Nova Orsinium are real, that the Sload Priests talk to their new God of Worms, and none of them serve the sick heir of the Septim line; we could see all this and know that it is true.
